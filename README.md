# 🏗 Scaffold-Sign-In-With-Ethereum

Welcome to the Scaffold template for Sign-In-With-Ethereum. This template uses the [Blockin](https://blockin.gitbook.com/blockin) library to sign-in and verify users. Blockin supports Sign-In-With-Ethereum and also extends it to support signing in with any blockchain, plus other cool features like native sign in requests with NFTs. 

For pull requests or issues with this repository, please reach out to the Blockin team or @trevormil23 on Twitter. 

# 🏗 Scaffold-ETH

> everything you need to build on Ethereum! 🚀

🧪 Quickly experiment with Solidity using a frontend that adapts to your smart contract:

# 🏄‍♂️ Quick Start

Prerequisites: [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) plus [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

> clone/fork 🏗 scaffold-eth:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-examples.git
```

> install and start your 👷‍ Hardhat chain:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth-examples
yarn install
yarn chain
```

> in a second terminal window, start your 📱 frontend:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth-examples
yarn start
```

> in a third terminal window, 🛰 deploy your contract:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth-examples
yarn deploy
```

🔏 Edit your smart contract `YourContract.sol` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`

📝 Edit your frontend `App.jsx` in `packages/react-app/src`

💼 Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy`

📱 Open http://localhost:3000 to see the app
